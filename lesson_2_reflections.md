## Lesson 2 Git reflections ##

**What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?**

**How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?** 

**How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?**
  u can use staging area with few commands:
  git diff 
  git diff --staged
  git diff commit1 commit2
  It very useful for checking yourself and seeing progress 

**What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?**

**How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?**
  git log --graph --oneline master other_branch_name

**What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?**

**What are the pros and cons of Git's automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?**

## Some reflections about git course ##
**How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?**


**How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?**


**What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?**


**Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?**


**How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?**


**How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?**


**Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?**

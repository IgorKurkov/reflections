## Lesson 3 git reflections ##
**When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?**


**Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?**



**Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?**



**What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?**


**How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?**


**When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?**
